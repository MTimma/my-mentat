Icon Guide and Additional Terms
Acquire.
Some cards have a special acquire box, shown
underneath their cost. You gain the effect here one time, at
the moment you acquire the card (and not later, when you
play it from your hand).

Acquire a Foldspace card from the Reserve.

Agent.
From the Swordmaster space, you can gain your
third Agent (that was placed next to the board during
setup of the game), then use it for the rest of the game.

Alliance — You may use this effect only
if you have the Alliance token of the
Faction shown. (Here, an Alliance with
the Spacing Guild.)

Control — If you win a Conflict with a Control reward (of
Arrakeen, Carthag, or Imperial Basin), place your Control
marker on the flag below that space (replacing any
opponent’s marker there). When a Conflict card is revealed
for a space that you already control, you may deploy one
troop from your supply to the Conflict.

Draw a card from your deck. If your deck is empty, reshuffle
the discard pile in your supply to form a new deck, then
continue to draw.

Draw an Intrigue card from the Intrigue Deck. Keep it face
down until you play it. You may look at it at any time.

Fremen Bond — You may use this effect if you have one or more
other Fremen cards in play. Two cards with Fremen Bond can
activate one another, regardless of order played. (See In Play.)

In Play — Cards you play on Agent turns and reveal during your
Reveal turn remain face up and “in play” until you clean up at the
end of your Reveal turn (unless they are trashed first).

Influence — You may use this effect only if
you have at least the amount of Influence
indicated with the given Faction. (Here, 2 or
more Influence with the Fremen.)

Gain Influence with the Faction shown:
Emperor, Spacing Guild, Bene Gesserit,
or Fremen.

Gain one, gain two, lose one Influence. Choose
any one of the four Factions. (When gaining
two Influence, you can’t choose two different
Factions.)

Lose a troop — When you lose a troop, return it to your supply
(not your garrison).

Maker. The three board spaces with the Maker icon each
gain 1 bonus spice during Phase 4: Makers if no Agent is
present. When you send an Agent to one of these board
spaces, you also gain all bonus spice there.

Mentat. Take the Mentat from its space on the board (if it’s
there; you can’t take it from another player or another
space). Place it on your Leader; you may use it as one of
your Agents to take an Agent turn. When you take the
Mentat as a Conflict reward, keep it as an Agent for next
round and don’t return it to the board at the end of this one.

Paying a cost. An arrow indicates a cost (left
of the arrow, or above it) and an effect (right
of the arrow, or below it). If you don’t pay the
cost, you don’t get the effect. You are never
forced to pay such a cost on a card.

Persuasion (in the amount shown). You receive Persuasion
mainly from the Reveal boxes on your cards. You use it to
acquire Imperium or Reserve cards, paying the cost shown
in the top right corner of a card.

Recall — When you recall one of your Agents, put it back on your
Leader. You may use it again on another Agent turn in the same
round.

Resources: Solari, Spice, Water. When you gain a
resource or pay one as a cost, it’s taken from or
returned to the bank. (For Solari and Spice, gain
or pay the amount shown.)

Retreat — When you retreat a troop, move it from the Conflict
back to your garrison.

Signet Ring. When you play your Signet Ring card on an
Agent turn, you use the Signet Ring ability (with the
corresponding icon) on your Leader.

Steal Intrigue. Each opponent who has four or more
Intrigue cards must give you one of them (selected at
random).

Sword. Each sword adds 1 strength to your strength total in
a Conflict.

Trash one card from your hand, discard pile, or in play.
Return it to the game box; it won’t be used for the rest of
the game. (Reserve cards are returned to their stack in the
Reserve instead.) Trashing is optional unless it’s paying a
cost, or if a card directs you to trash itself.

Troop. Recruit one troop; take it from your supply and put
it in your garrison on the game board. (If you recruited the
troop while sending an Agent to a Combat space, you may
deploy it to the Conflict.)

Victory Point. When you gain a Victory Point, move your
Score marker one space up on the Score track. When you
lose one, move your Score marker one space down.
