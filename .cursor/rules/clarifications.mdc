Clarifications
Baron Vladimir Harkonnen — To use the Masterstroke ability,
choose two of the four Baron Harkonnen tokens and place them on
your Leader with the Faction side face down. (Return the other two
to the box without letting any opponents see them.) Later, reveal
your choices as described to gain your reward.
Bindu Suspension — You must play this Intrigue card at the start of
your Agent turn, before doing anything else. When you do, draw a
card, then immediately end your turn.
Calculated Hire — This Intrigue card can only take the Mentat from
its starting position in the Landsraad.
Demand Respect — If you win a Conflict that rewards you with
spice, you may take that spice first, then use it to play this Intrigue
card. (You may also play To the Victor… to gain the spice to then
play Demand Respect.)
Kwisatz Haderach — You may play this card to take an Agent turn
even if you have no Agents left in your supply, as it lets you send
an Agent that is already on a board space. You may send an Agent
back to the space that it was just on.
If a board space can be used only once per game (High Council,
Swordmaster), you can’t use Kwisatz Haderach to send an Agent
there more than once. You can’t overcome The Voice and send an
Agent to a board space where you can’t send an Agent.
If you move an agent away from a space with a Maker icon,
and that space remains empty until Phase 4, bonus spice does
accumulate there.
Paul Atreides / Poison Snooper — You can’t look at the top card of
your deck if it is empty. (You can’t reshuffle your discard pile and
form a new deck until you need to draw a card.)
Test of Humanity — Opponents make their choices starting from
your left and proceeding clockwise. Each opponent must choose
something they can do; they can’t discard if their hand is empty, or
lose a deployed troop if they have none. An opponent who decides
to discard chooses which card; it is not random.
The Voice — Use one of your available Control markers to mark
the board space you choose, then remove it on your next turn.
(The Voice only stops opponents from sending Agents to that
board space for one turn.)
This does prevent Kwisatz Haderach from sending an Agent to the
board space you chose.
