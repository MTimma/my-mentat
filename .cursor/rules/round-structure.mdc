These are the official rules that the player reads and plays by. Our application should follow it precisely.

Round Structure
DUNE: IMPERIUM is played in a series of rounds. Each round consists of five phases, in this order:
1. Round Start 2. Player Turns (Agent Turn Reveal Turn)3. Combat 4. Makers 5. Recall



Phase 1: Round Start

Each round begins by revealing a new Conflict card from the top of the Conflict Deck. Place it face
up in the space next to the Conflict Deck (on top of any Conflict cards from previous rounds).
Next, each player draws five cards from their own deck, forming their
hand for the round.



Phase 2: Player Turns

Starting with the player who has the First Player marker
and continuing clockwise, players take one turn at a time.
On your turn, you will take either an Agent turn or a Reveal
turn. These types of turns are detailed over the next three
pages. Generally, you will take Agent turns until you run
out of Agents to place, then you will take a Reveal turn.
(Note that Agent turns are optional. If you choose to, you
can take a Reveal turn while you still have Agents instead
of taking an Agent turn.)
Once you’ve taken a Reveal turn, your turns are skipped for
the rest of the phase, while other players finish taking their
turns. Once all players have taken a Reveal turn, this phase
ends.
You may play any Plot Intrigue cards you have during
this phase, at any point during one of your own Agent or
Reveal turns.


Card Anatomy
The effects of each card in your deck are divided into two parts: an
Agent box and a Reveal box. On any given turn, you may use the
effects contained in only one of those boxes: the Agent box during
an Agent turn, or the Reveal box during a Reveal turn
(this should correlate to the "Card" type in @GameTypes.ts)
Name 
Faction (Not all cards are part of a Faction.)
Agent icons
Agent box
Reveal box
Persuasion Cost
Acquire effect (When player buys a card from Imperium row - this effect happens. Not all cards have an Acquire effect.)


Player Turn – Agent Turn
In an Agent turn, you play one card from your hand face up in
front of you, using it to send an Agent from your Leader to an
unoccupied space on the game board.
This board space must have an icon
in its upper left corner matching one
of the Agent icons on the card.
You must choose only one Agent icon on your
card; one card can’t send multiple Agents.
You can’t send an Agent to a board space that already has one.
You must pay any costs or meet any requirements of the board space
you choose.
In addition, the Agent box of the card you played may provide an effect
when you play it on an Agent turn. (You ignore the Reveal box of the card
during Agent turns.)
If a card does not have any Agent icons on it, you may
not play it during an Agent turn. It may only be revealed
during a Reveal turn.
When you play a card and send an Agent to a board space,
you gain the effects of the board space as well as the
effects contained in the Agent box of the card. If the board
space belongs to one of the Factions, you also move your
cube one space up on its Influence track. You may carry
out all these effects in any order.
Some card effects are written out, but many are iconized.
Refer to the separate Board Space Guide sheet for an
explanation of all board spaces, and the back cover of the
rulebook for a guide to all game icons and additional game
terms.
Arrows on cards and on the board (>) indicate that there
is a cost (left of the arrow, or above it) you must pay to get
the effect (right of the arrow, or below it). You are never
forced to pay such a cost. However, if you don’t, you won’t
gain the effect. (When you play Fremen Camp, you may decide
                  not to pay 2 spice to recruit 3 troops.)

The seven different Agent icons are:
Emperor
Spacing Guild
Bene Gesserit
Fremen
Landsraad
City
Spice Trade
The "Sardaukar Legion" card has two Agent icons.
The Emperor icon allows you to send your Agent to
either of the two Emperor board spaces, while the
Landsraad icon allows you to send it to one of the
five board spaces in the Landsraad instead.

Board Space Costs
To send an Agent to some board spaces, you must pay a cost.
If you can’t pay the cost immediately (before resolving any effects
of the space or the card you played), you can’t send your Agent
there.
Here are the two Emperor spaces on the game
board. The top space, “Conspire,” requires that
you pay 4 spice to send an Agent there.
The bottom space, “Wealth,” has no
additional cost.

Sietch Tabr Influence
The Sietch Tabr board space has a unique
requirement. To send an Agent there, you must
have 2 or more Influence with the Fremen.

Deploying Troops to the Conflict
At the start of each round, the current Conflict card is revealed,
offering rewards for which the players will compete in Combat.
Whenever the cube icon appears on a card or board
space, you recruit one troop. Take a troop from your
supply and place it in your garrison on the game board. (If you
run out of troops in your supply, you can’t recruit more until
some return there.)
You can’t earn rewards with troops sitting in your
garrison, however. You may deploy them to a
Conflict when you send an Agent to a Combat
space. Combat spaces are board spaces that
feature a desert illustration and crossed swords. While most of
these appear on the planet Dune itself, three appear with the
Factions: one with the Spacing Guild (Heighliner) and two with
the Fremen (Hardy Warriors and Stillsuits).
When you send an Agent to a Combat
space, you may deploy troops to the
Conflict area—the area of the game
board in the center of the garrisons. You
may deploy any or all troops recruited
during your current turn (from both the
board space and the card you played),
plus up to two more troops from your garrison. (Any troops
you recruit but choose not to deploy to the Conflict are placed
in your garrison as usual.)

Control Bonuses
Some Conflict cards (explained more in Phase 3: Combat)
reward a player with control over one of three spaces on Dune:
Arrakeen, Carthag, or Imperial Basin (based on the card’s
title). If you win such a Conflict, take a Control marker from
your supply and place it on the flag below the
appropriate board space.
While your Control marker is on one of these
spaces, you receive the bonus shown whenever
any player (yourself included) sends an Agent there. The bonus
is 1 Solari for Arrakeen or Carthag, and 1 spice for Imperial
Basin.
When a Conflict card is revealed for a space that you already
control, you receive a defensive bonus: you may deploy one
troop from your supply to the Conflict.

Harvesting Spice
There are three board spaces on Arrakis with a Maker
icon, where you may harvest spice: The Great Flat,
Hagga Basin, and Imperial Basin. When you send an
Agent to one of them, you gain the base value of spice
shown on the space, plus any bonus spice that has
accumulated there. (See Phase 4: Makers for details.)
When you send an Agent to Hagga
Basin, you gain 2 spice from the bank
and take any bonus spice that has
accumulated there.

Example:
John plays Dune, the Desert Planet
to send an Agent to Imperial Basin. He
collects spice from the space. His card
provides no additional Agent turn effect.
Imperial Basin is a Combat space. John didn’t recruit any
troops with either the card he played or the board space
where he sent his Agent. But he does have three troops in his garrison.
He decides to fight as hard as he can, and deploys two troops from his
garrison to the Conflict—the maximum number allowed.
Abby plays Duncan Idaho to send an
Agent to Carthag. John’s Control marker is
there from an earlier round, so he takes
1 Solari from the bank.
From the board space, Abby recruits a troop and draws
an Intrigue card. With Duncan Idaho, she chooses to pay
1 water to recruit another troop and draw a card from her deck.
Abby could place her two newly recruited troops in her garrison. But
Carthag is also a Combat space, and she senses the possibility of victory
over John. She deploys those troops to the Conflict, plus one more that she
already had in her garrison. (If she’d had a second troop there, she could
have deployed it too.)
Ned decides to use his turn to build
up forces to fight on a later round. He
plays Bene Gesserit Initiate to send
an Agent to Rally Troops. He must pay
the space’s additional cost of 4 Solari. From the Bene
Gesserit Initiate, he draws a card from his deck. From the
Rally Troops board space, he recruits four troops. It isn’t a
Combat space, however, so he can’t deploy any troops to the Conflict, and
places them in his garrison instead.

Player Turn – Reveal Turn
When a player has no more Agents for Agent turns (or chooses not to use any Agents they have remaining), that player takes a Reveal turn.
This consists of the following steps in order: Reveal Cards, Resolve Reveal Effects, Set Strength, and Clean Up.

Reveal Cards
Reveal all cards remaining in your hand, placing them
face up in play in front of you. Keep them separate from
other cards you played previously on Agent turns.

Resolve Reveal Effects
You now gain the effects in the Reveal boxes of all the
cards you just revealed (but not those of any cards you
played during Agent turns earlier in the round).
You may resolve Reveal effects in any
order you like. In addition, you may
use Persuasion that you’ve gained
to acquire new cards for your deck
before, between, or after your Reveal
effects.

Set Strength
Total your strength for the Combat this round.
Each troop you have in the Conflict is worth 2 strength.
(Troops in your garrison or supply contribute nothing.)
Each sword you revealed during your Reveal turn is
worth 1 strength.
You must have at least one troop in the Conflict to
have any strength. If your last troop is ever removed,
your strength becomes 0, and can’t be increased by any
means, including swords on cards you revealed.
When you’ve totaled your
strength, announce it to
your opponents and move
your Combat marker to
the corresponding space on the Combat track. If your
strength is over 20, flip the Combat marker to the
+20 side and start again from the beginning of the track.

Clean Up
Remove all the cards from in front of you (from your
Agent and Reveal turns) and put them in your discard
pile.

Acquiring Cards
The Persuasion you gain during a round is used during your
Reveal turn to acquire new cards for your deck. You may
acquire any of the five cards in the Imperium Row, or Arrakis Liaison
or The Spice Must Flow from the Reserve. (Foldspace is acquired at
the board space of the same name, as described in the separate
Board Space Guide sheet.)
The cost to acquire a card is shown at the top right of that card.
You may acquire as many cards as you like, as long as you have
enough Persuasion to spend. You may pool Persuasion from multiple
sources (cards and board spaces) to acquire one card, and may split
Persuasion from a single source to pay for different cards. Persuasion
is not represented by any tokens because you can never save it; any
Persuasion you don’t use during your Reveal turn is lost.
When you acquire a card, place it in your discard pile (face up to the
right of your Leader). You don’t get to use the new card right away;
you will shuffle it along with the rest of your discard pile when you
run out of cards to draw.
The Imperium Row must always have five cards; whenever it does
not, replace missing cards from the top of the Imperium Deck. This
means that after you acquire one card, you may then acquire the
card that replaces it (if you have enough Persuasion).

Example:
John has no more Agents when his turn comes, so he
takes a Reveal turn. He reveals the three cards remaining in
his hand: Imperial Spy, Smuggler’s Thopter, and Stilgar.
Smuggler’s Thopter has an effect for John to resolve.
He takes 1 spice from the bank. His cards also provide
Persuasion and swords.
John’s cards give him a total of 4 Persuasion. He uses 3 of
it to acquire Space Travel from the Imperium Row, placing
it in his discard pile. A new card is then dealt from the
Imperium Deck to fill the empty space in the Imperium Row.
Although John has 1 Persuasion remaining, there are no
cards available that cost only 1.
John has two troops in the Conflict, providing a total of 4 strength. The cards he revealed
this turn provide 4 more: 1 sword from Imperial Spy and 3 swords from Stilgar. He sets his
Combat marker at 8 on the Combat track.
Finally, John takes the cards in front of him and puts them in his discard pile.
The phase continues. Abby and Ned will take a Reveal turn at some point. John is done until
the Combat phase.

Phase 3: Combat
Combat is resolved during this phase, but first, players have the chance to play Combat Intrigue cards.

Combat Intrigue Cards
Starting with the player who has the
First Player marker and continuing
clockwise, each player with at least
one troop in the Conflict may play any
number of Combat Intrigue cards, or
may pass.
You are not required to pass just
because you passed earlier in the
Combat phase. Once all players
involved in Combat pass consecutively,
you then resolve the Combat.
If a card changes the number of troops a player has in
the Conflict (or otherwise alters their strength), they
adjust their Combat marker accordingly on the Combat
track. (Remember: if you have no troops in the Conflict,
your strength is 0.)
A few Combat Intrigue cards do something “when
you win a Conflict.” You do not play these now, before
resolving the Combat. Instead, wait until you’ve won,
then play them (before moving on to the next phase).

Resolve Combat
Rewards from the Conflict card are given to players based on their
strength, as shown on the Combat track.
The player with the highest strength wins the Conflict
and gains the top reward on the Conflict card.
The player with the second highest strength gains the
second reward. In a 4-player game (only), the player
with the third highest strength receives the third
reward.
A player with 0 strength does not receive any reward.
Refer to this rulebook’s back cover for a guide to the
icons used on Conflict cards.
Once all rewards have been given, each player takes their troops from
the Conflict and puts them in their supply (not their garrison). Reset all
Combat markers to 0 on the Combat track.
Ties
When players tie for first place, no one wins the Conflict. The tied
players each receive the second reward. (In a 4-player game, if two
players tie for first place, the other two players still compete for the
third reward.)
When players tie for second place, they each receive the third reward.
Players tying for third place receive nothing.

Example:
As the Combat Phase begins, John has 8 strength and Abby has 6 strength. John has the First Player marker, but he’s already ahead in the
Conflict. He passes on the chance to play a Combat Intrigue card.
Abby is next, and does play an Intrigue card, Ambush. It gives her 4 more strength, and she advances her Combat marker to 10.
Ned is next in player order, but has no troops in the Conflict. He has 0 strength and can’t take part in this phase.
It’s now back to John. Even though he passed earlier in this phase, he could now decide to play an Intrigue card. But he checks his Intrigue
cards, and none of them are Combat Intrigue cards. He passes again.
Abby, satisfied with her victory, also passes.
With 10 strength, Abby wins the Conflict. The top reward of the Conflict card, Siege of Arrakeen, gives her 1 Victory Point and control of
Arrakeen. She advances her Score marker one space on the Score track, and places one of her Control markers on the flag below the Arrakeen
board space.
John wins the second-place reward, taking 4 Solari from the bank.
Ned receives nothing from this Conflict. He has 0 strength, and the third-place reward isn’t available in a 3-player game anyway

Phase 4: Makers
In this phase, spice can accumulate on certain board spaces. Check each of the three board spaces with a Maker icon: The Great Flat,
Hagga Basin, and Imperial Basin. If the space does not have an Agent, place 1 spice from the bank on that space (in the spot designated for
bonus spice). This spice is added to any bonus spice that may already be there from previous rounds.
There is an Agent in Imperial Basin. (John played it there earlier this round.) There are no Agents in the Great Flat or Hagga Basin,
however, so each of those spaces gets 1 bonus spice. The Great Flat already had 1 bonus spice from a previous round, so now it has 2
bonus spice.

Phase 5: Recall
If any player is at 10 or more Victory Points on the Score track, or if the Conflict Deck is
empty, the Endgame is triggered.
If no one has won, prepare the next round:
• Return the Mentat to its designated space in the Landsraad (if it’s not already there).
• Players recall their Agents, returning them to their Leaders.
• Pass the First Player marker clockwise to the next player, then begin a new
round with Phase 1.
No one has reached 10 Victory Points, so the Mentat and the player Agents are returned to the appropriate
places, and the First Player marker passes clockwise to Abby. A new round then begins, with phase 1.

Endgame
First, you may play and resolve any
Endgame Intrigue cards you have.
Then whoever has the most Victory
Points is declared the winner.
If the case of a tie, tiebreakers are,
in order: amount of spice, Solari,
water, and garrisoned troops.
