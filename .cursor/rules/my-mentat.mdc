Application manifesto

My Mentat is a web application for analysing Dune: Imperium games

Features:
Input and save game turns of a Dune: Imperium game
View the game and navigate through the turns in any direction
See the probability of:
 * player is holding a specific card in their hand
 * next intrigue card will be from a group of user selected cards
 * next imperium row card will be from a group of user selected cards

Use case scenarios:
As a beginner player I want to know how likely it is to draw a combat intrigue in the first round
As a ranked game player I want to know how efficiently I played my last game
As a tournament host I want to know how lucky was the player to pull off their winning move
As a Youtuber I want to set up a scenario to showcase an amazing combo

IMPORTANT:
The app has some turn eligibility validation and game engine implemented but it is not the primary aspect and should not be limited to.
My Mentat is not a playable game implementation of Dune: Imperium
User should not have to input all the hidden information for other players, game deck etc
Only visible information to all players like played cards, imperium row, etc, should be the input
In perfect case hand size, influence, resources, victory points should be calculated by the app. Adjusting by user should be possible.
User should be able to input the played cards in the turn of the active player

Choose to do in turn:
Play intrigue card (can be done at any time of the turn)
Play a card (choose 1 from deck) OR Reveal (choose n from deck where n is the size of hand)
